# Healthpass Application

Hi there, 
This is Healthpass, an application built in 2 days for #nhsnavigationhack, in order to help migrants and refugees understand how to use England's National Health Services.

It requires python and django to be installed. Dont worry, just need to do copy and paste these lines to your terminal: 
- sudo apt-get install python2.7 (Linux) 
(For Windows installation: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip install django

Once python, django have been installed, let's roll: 
- cd /path/of/the/project/root/folder/
- python manager.py runserver 

See how it looks: 
http://localhost:8000

That's it!
